            <h1>Advait Deshpande, B.S in Computer Science</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Sophomore at Iowa State University</p>
            <p> I am a sophomore at Iowa State University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in General Artificial Intelligence. 
                I have hands-on experience with AI/ML projects across both front-end and back-end development, 
                and I work extensively with software engineering concepts such as object-oriented design. 
                My primary interests include Generative AI, low-level development, and machine learning.</p>

                <p>The first project focuses on designing a Web page using
                HTML and CSS. In terms of the layout, a navigation bar is
                created at the top displaying a list of menu items. We
                include some text describing each section of the page.
                Additionally, we included two images to enhance the visual
                appeal of the page.</p>
